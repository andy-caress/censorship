            Who inspires you?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            My culture and family inspire me. Figures like my grandmother and younger siblings give a sense of responsibility to carry and build for them to be more successful than I am.
            <br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            Are you a minority?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            I would agree with being a minority. Being an African American alone, generations before I, and still till this day, face discrimination, suppression, inequality, and many other factors that hinder one from being successful or able to
            educate one’s environment.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            What does being a minority means to you?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            Being a minority means taking on a challenge voted by the most majority.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            How have you represented being a minority?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            I was born into a race full of misconceptions, corrupt systems, hurt, betrayal, and eagerness to fight back. I was born into it without hesitation. I didn’t have a say if I wanted to be a minority or not.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            When did you feel the most separated from the majority?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            Times that I feel most separated from my culture is when I am away from home. Not being in my “natural habitat” or a certain way of living, speaking, reacting, or living everyday life situations.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            When did the majority attempt to suppress you?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            Personally, I cannot think of a time when the majority has tried to suppress me.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            How does your inspiration further your art practice?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            My inspiration furthers my art practice by remembering my roots and realizing who I am as a person. Vividly, I can remember my first instances of drawings and the figure I wanted to be for other African American artists.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            Do you hold any responsibility as a minority?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            As a minority, I hold the responsibility of continuing to give back to those in my environment, or those in the same circumstances or worse. I must hold myself accountable to help individuals break through walls I once was stuck in.
            Staying
            true to my identity and never changing my perspective wherever I go.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            What are the biggest challenges you face as a minority?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            The biggest challenge I face is realizing that despite me being Asian, I still grew up in a white household with a different culture and with very few Asian influences. My biggest challenge is realizing my privilege and taking a step back
            to educate myself on the history, the traditions, and grasping the Asian culture.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            Do you feel like being in a minority has inspired you as an artist?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            My biggest challenges are to continue to walk forward in uncomfortable situations and communicate and build relationships of high importance outside of my race. Entering rooms with ideas that can help change the masses. Spaces I wasn’t
            supposed to make it to. That I would say is my biggest challenge as a minority.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            Do you feel like being in a minority has inspired you as an artist?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            Yes/No. I say yes because I view myself differently than other students. Being African American and coming from my environment, I know have to work as twice as hard, give twice as much effort, and do more what is expected to be
            successful.
            On the other hand, I say no because I have more expansions and interests in life than just art. Art is one of my outlets to show my full potential, but I do not think that is my only service I have to offer as a man.
            <br><br><br>
          </p2>

          <p1>
            In which way do you show censorship in your work?
            <br><br>
          </p1>
          <p2>
            I show censorship through my history and roots, struggles my race face daily, ideas that need to more aware to the public, and interest that can help change one’s negative way of thinking about one another.
